    {"name": "English 1", "head": "Jake Moffat", "description": "English 1 is designed to help students gain skills in thinking, writing, and speaking about literature. The course emphasizes both oral and written analysis of literature, and students will compose analytical papers, offer creative and reflective pieces, and engage in seminar discussions. Through a variety of literary forms (i.e., novels, short stories, poetry, and drama), students will consider the themes of coming of age, personal and social justice, and the individual’s roles and responsibilities in society. The course not only aims to build strong critical thinking and expressive skills but also encourages students to create supportive and collaborative spaces where students feel heard, respected, and empowered to use their voice."}, 
    {"name": "Modern World History", "head": "Ben Hunter", "description": "Modern World History is the first year of a sequential Social Sciences Department curriculum and is designed to provide all entering Sacred Heart students with a common background in academic and social science skills, cultural concepts, historical appreciation, and essentials of geographic knowledge. Skills introduced and reinforced include summarizing and paraphrasing, categorization, understanding of historical perspective and bias, note taking and organization, presentation skills, introduction of research skills, and some persuasive writing. Students will write a research paper in the spring semester as well as work on collaborative and individual projects. Areas of study include Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. The geography component of the course teaches the importance of geography as a historical determinant and encourages environmental stewardship. Students will also participate actively and regularly in the SHP gardens."}, 
    {"name": "Biology", "head": "Diane Sweeney", "description": "Biology is a lab-based course for freshmen and sophomores designed to implement the Next Generation Science Standards. Throughout the year, students will build skills needed to design and create lab investigations based on biological concepts such as energy transformation, cell biology, and inherited traits. Other topics that are covered using the NGSS tools include evolution and natural selection, diversity of living organisms on Earth, and DNA/RNA structure and function. Lab skills will include proper use of lab equipment, data collection, organization, and analysis. Interactive notebooks will be required by each student."}, 
    {"name": "Biology Honors", "head": "Diane Sweeney", "description": "Biology Honors is designed for the highly motivated student with the ability to master in-depth biological concepts. The course covers a general biology curriculum with an emphasis on the microscopic environment. There is the expectation that the student will be able to visualize abstract biological concepts and investigate open-ended, inquiry-based lab experiments. Students interested in future Honors or AP science courses are encouraged to take this course. In addition to working with advanced lab equipment, students will have the opportunity to develop their own hypotheses and to design experiments to explore specific questions."},

    {"name": "Algebra", "head": "Jorge Reyes", "description": "This course is designed to develop skills leading to the analysis of problems which result in the solving of linear, quadratic, rational, and radical equations and systems of linear equations.  Students learn to use various problem-solving strategies in order to analyze these and other types of problems.  They explore the relationship between graphs and different types of equations analytically. An emphasis is placed on real-world problems that can be solved by writing and working an algebraic expression or equation."}, 
    {"name": "Geometry", "prerequisites": "Algebra 1 or satisfactory HSPT scores", "head": "Jorge Reyes", "description": "This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of geometric concepts that will prepare them for subsequent course work in mathematics, and allow them to be able to recognize geometric principles in the world around them. Students are introduced to the topics of plane, solid and analytic geometry, while continuing to use and extend some of the concepts learned in algebra. Students learn about angles, parallel lines, triangles and other types of polygons, congruence, similarity, circles, various types of solid figures, area and volume, coordinate geometry, and are introduced to right triangle trigonometry. Explorations on the iPad and hands-on projects may be used to help students discover and use many geometric concepts formalized in the text."}, 
    {"name": "Geometry Honors", "prerequisites": "satisfactory scores on the Geometry placement test", "head": "Jorge Reyes", "description": "This course is a more rigorous, fast-paced Geometry course designed for students with demonstrably strong Algebra 1 skills and inquisitive mathematical minds. Students are introduced to the topics of plane, solid and analytic geometry, while continuing to use and extend some of the concepts learned in algebra. Algebraic ideas are extended in this course through explorations with vectors and parametric equations. Students learn about angles, parallel lines, triangles and other types of polygons, congruence, similarity, transformations, circles, various types of solid figures, area and volume, coordinate geometry, and right triangle trigonometry. More emphasis is placed on constructing deductive justification for theorems and other assertions than in the regular Geometry course. Other possible topics include logic, the fourth dimension, and non-Euclidean geometries. Hands-on projects and explorations on the iPad may be used to help students discover and use many geometric concepts explored in the course and formalized in the text. Possible projects include construction of the Euler segment on the iPad, programming the TI calculator, and a geometric probability “carnival”."}, 
    {"name": "Algebra 2", "prerequisites": "Geometry or satisfactory scores on the Algebra 2 placement test", "head": "Jorge Reyes", "description": "This course is designed to extend and deepen students’ understanding of various previously learned algebraic concepts as well as introduce them to new algebra topics. Students study relations, functions and their graphs, linear equations and inequalities, quadratic and other polynomial functions, factoring, direct and inverse variation, powers and roots, exponential and logarithmic functions, complex numbers, rational functions, conics, and probability. Extensive use of the graphing calculator allows the emphasis to be on problem solving and exploration and analysis of real-world applications."}, 
    {"name": "Algebra 2 Trig Honors", "prerequisites": "exceptional performance in Geometry, satisfactory mastery of Geometry Honors, or exceptional scores on the Algebra 2 placement test", "head": "Jorge Reyes", "description": "This course is a more rigorous, fast-paced version of Algebra 2 that also includes a solid introduction to trigonometry. The topics covered in this course include those in the regular Algebra 2 course, but at a more challenging level. Students study relations, functions and their graphs, linear equations and inequalities, quadratic and other polynomial functions, direct and inverse variation, powers and roots, exponential and logarithmic functions, complex numbers, rational functions, conics, sequences and series. In addition, other topics covered include inverse functions, higher degree equations, and an extensive study of circular functions, trigonometry, and its applications. Extensive use of the graphing calculator allows the emphasis to be on problem solving and exploration and analysis of real-world applications."},

    {"name": "Introduction to Catholic Christianity", "head": "Virginia Boesen", "description": "This course is a comprehensive survey of Catholic doctrine.  Students will acquire a foundation and vocabulary for religious studies.  The following topics will be covered: Sacred Heart and traditions, identity and social development, faith, salvation, the nature and person of Jesus Christ, the nature and mission of the Catholic Church, the sacraments, prayer and spirituality, and ecumenical and interfaith concerns."},
